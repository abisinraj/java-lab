Program No. 3: Fibonacci.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input the limit (n) until which the series should be printed.
Step 3: Initialize first=0 and second=1.
Step 4: Loop from 1 to n, printing the current term.
Step 5: Calculate next = first + second, then update first and second.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 4: ArmstrongRange.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input the lower and upper bounds of a range.
Step 3: For each number in the range, calculate the sum of the cubes of its digits.

Step 5: If equal, print the number (it's an Armstrong number).
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 5: Triangle.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input three side lengths a, b, and c.
Step 3: Verify if they form a triangle (a+b>c, a+c>b, b+c>a).
Step 4: Check if all sides are equal (Equilateral), two are equal (Isosceles), or none (Scalene).
Step 5: Output the type of triangle.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 6: ArrayElements.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input the elements into an array.
Step 3: Sort the array in ascending or descending order.
Step 4: Identify the smallest (first element) and largest (last element).
Step 5: Identify the second largest (second to last element).
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 7: MatrixTraceTranspose.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input dimensions and elements of a matrix.
Step 3: Calculate the trace (sum of diagonal elements).
Step 4: Calculate the transpose (swap rows and columns: T[j][i] = M[i][j]).
Step 5: Output the trace and the transposed matrix.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 8: SumRevMain.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input a number.
Step 3: While number > 0, extract digits, add to sum, and build reverse.
Step 4: Print the sum of digits.
Step 5: Print the reversed number.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 9: AnagramCheck.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input two strings.
Step 3: Convert strings to lowercase and sort their characters.
Step 4: Compare sorted strings for equality.
Step 5: If equal, print 'Anagram', else print 'Not an Anagram'.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 10: RemoveVowels.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input a string.
Step 3: Traverse the string and check if each character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).
Step 4: Reconstruct the string by excluding vowels.
Step 5: Output the new string.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 11: StudentResult.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Create classes to store student details and marks.
Step 3: Input marks for various subjects.
Step 4: Calculate the total and average of those marks.
Step 5: Display the formatted student results.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 12: ComplexSum.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers.
Step 3: Sum the real parts together.
Step 4: Sum the imaginary parts together.
Step 5: Output the result as a complex number (a + bi).
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 13: CountObjects.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Define a static counter variable in the class.
Step 3: Increment the counter inside the constructor.
Step 4: Create some objects using the constructor.
Step 5: Output the value of the static counter.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 14: RectangleApplet.java
Step 1: Start (Applet init)
