Algorithm for AnagramCheck.java:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Read two strings from the user.
Step 3: If their lengths are not equal, print 'Not anagrams' and exit.
Step 4: Convert strings to character arrays.
Step 5: Sort both character arrays.
Step 6: Compare the sorted arrays.
Step 7: If they match, print 'Anagrams', else print 'Not anagrams'.
Step 8: End the program.

Algorithm for ArmstrongRange.java:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Read the upper and lower bounds for the range.
Step 3: Loop from lower bound to upper bound.
Step 4: For each number, calculate the sum of the cubes of its digits.
Step 5: If the sum equals the number itself, print the number.
Step 6: Continue until the upper bound is reached.
Step 7: End the program.

Algorithm for ArrayElements.java:
Step 1: Start the program.
