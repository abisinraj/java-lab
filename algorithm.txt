ALGORITHMS ORDERED BY PROGRAM NUMBER
========================================

Program No. 1: DistanceCalculator.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
Step 3: Calculate dx = x2 - x1 and dy = y2 - y1.
Step 4: Calculate distance = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2).
Step 5: Output the distance.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 2: Calculator.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
Step 3: Use a switch case or if-else to perform the corresponding operation.
Step 4: Display the result of the operation.
Step 5: Handle any invalid operators if necessary.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 3: Fibonacci.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input the limit (n) until which the series should be printed.
Step 3: Initialize first=0 and second=1.
Step 4: Loop from 1 to n, printing the current term.
Step 5: Calculate next = first + second, then update first and second.
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 4: ArmstrongRange.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input the lower and upper bounds of a range.
Step 3: For each number in the range, calculate the sum of the cubes of its digits.
Step 4: Compare the sum to the original number.
Step 5: If equal, print the number (it's an Armstrong number).
Step 6: Stop

Program No. 5: Triangle.java
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input three side lengths a, b, and c.
Step 3: Verify if they form a triangle (a+b>c, a+c>b, b+c>a).
Step 4: Check if all sides are equal (Equilateral), two are equal (Isosceles), or none (Scalene).
Step 5: Output the type of triangle.
Step 6: Stop
